The first period is intended to solve the labor shortage problem in the Netherlands, while the second and third period were a consequence of chain migration for the purpose of family reunification and formation. While Turkey was not the sole source of immigrants to the Netherlands, Turkish immigration from the 1960s and on has resulted in Turkish becoming one of the dominant non-Western ethnicity in the Netherlands. A graph of Turkish immigration to the Netherlands is given in <a href="#figure_1">Figure 1</a>.

According to <a href="#katzenson_2015">Katzenson (2015)</a>, "the goal of the guest-worker program was to [secure a workforce] that can withstand [the] seasonal or temporary characteristic of the job." Although intended to be a program to gather a temporary workforce, immigration in the subsequent period began to take on a more permanent nature.</h3>
                                                                    <h3>The second period (1980) was the immigration of family members from Turkey in order to unite families and communities in the Netherlands. In this period, Turkish immigrants immigrated to the Netherlands in a more permanent manner, as family members were brought over and employers kept their immigrant work force. The third period (late 1990) included not only the immigration of family members to reunify families, but also the formation of families within Turkish immigrants. At the same time as the third period of migration, the population of second and third generation Turkish immigrants living in the Netherlands has increased dramatically. In a table shown by <a href="#zorlu_2001">Zorlu (2001)</a>, there are approximately 104,000 second generation Turkish immigrants living in the Netherlands.</h3>

Their interaction with Dutch can be described using <a href="#muysken_2013">Muysken (2013)</a>’s insertion strategy. The reason that this contact can be classified as insertion is because Turkish immigrants still interact in mostly Turkish, but features of Dutch morphemes are adopted. <a href="#sevinc_2014">Sevinç (2014)</a> also categorizes the change in Turkish spoken by Turkish immigrants born in the Netherlands with the insertion strategy, noting that the tendency to use the Turkish morpheme “yap” (translation: to do) followed by a Dutch word is only observed in third generation immigrants.</h3>

This allows the listener identify what the object that is acted upon. In the case of native Turkish, adding an “i” to “dizler” denotes that it’s “the series that is being liked”. However, such objects are not typically marked in English nor Dutch.</h3>

In addition to applying the linguistic features as described above, Turkish immigrants born in the Netherlands tend to consider themselves more Dutch than Turkish, and they think that Dutch is a more important language compared to Turkish. Consequently, Turkish tend to be used less in the second generation than in the first generation, and even more so in the third generation. <a href="#sevinc_2014">Sevinç (2014)</a> provides a testimony of a participant in their study (referred to as Misra) who cannot connect with their cousin’s friends in Turkey because Misra did not speak Turkish well. Misra also notes that they would sometimes call their mother or father and tell them in Dutch, who would translate it into Turkish. An illustration of the encounter is given in <a href="#figure_2">Figure 2</a>.</h3>
